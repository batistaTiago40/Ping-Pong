# Ping-Pong
I created this game following the classes of the DevSamurai course.

Basic Ping-Pong game using HTML Canva, including: Scoreboard, speed of the ball being changed according to the score and one of the rackets being controlled by the computer.
After following the steps in the course and creating the base game, I added the game's difficulty, when the player scores a point, the computer's speed increases, making it difficult for the player to score more points, but when the computer scores a point, his racket slows down, making it difficult for the player to score more points. easier for the player to score points.
